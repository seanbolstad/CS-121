    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Sean Bolstad and I'm taking some classess to learn new skills that I can hopefully use in my personal life and career. I work in regulatory compliance and technology is quickly becoming a key part of my role and the industry, so I figured I would start learning as much as I can. I'm really enjoying this class so far and looking forward to continuing to learn new things.</p>
    
    <p>I live in SE with my wife and two kids, ages 3 and 8 months. Our house is not big so we spend as much time outside as we can, either at parks or splashing in puddles around the neighborhood. I'm really looking forward to this summer so we can get out for some vacations and fun hikes in the nice weather.</p>

    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Now that we have two kids, I've had to adjust which hobbies I allocate my time and effort to.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Golf</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>I'm not very good but I enjoy the time oustide.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Hiking</strong>
        <ul>
        <li> Not easy with a toddler and a baby but we try.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Music</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>I'm trying as hard as I can to get my toddler into drums and guitar.</li>
        <li>So far, the results are mixed and drumsticks can be <em>really</em> dangerous.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Yardwork</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>We have a large yard so more of a required hobby.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
